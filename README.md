# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to this little lecture on machine learning (ML). 

ML can be viewed as a collection of statistical algorithms used to

1. predict values (supervised ML) or to
2. investigate data structure (unsupervised ML).

Our focus is on *supervised ML*. Depending on if we predict numbers or classes, we talk about *regression* or *classification*. 

## Organization

The lecture is split into four parts, each of which is accompanied with an R and Python notebook with background and examples. You will find them in the corresponding subfolders.

1. Regression and Classification Revisited 
2. Model Selection
    - Performance metrics and loss functions
    - Simple validation, cross-validation
    - Grid search
3. Trees
    - Decision trees
    - Random forests
    - Gradient boosting
4. Neural Nets
